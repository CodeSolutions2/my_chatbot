Yes, it is possible to create a REST API endpoint using GitHub Actions. Here is a simple example:\n\n```yaml\nname: API Endpoint\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: '14'\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm install\n\n      - name: Build and deploy API\n        run: |\n          npm run build\n          npm start\n```\n\nIn this example, the GitHub Actions workflow triggers on a push to the main branch. It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and then builds and deploys the API. You would need to replace the placeholder commands (`npm run build` and `npm start`) with the actual commands to build and start your API server.

To use GitHub Actions with a runner to create an endpoint for REST API Post requests, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up a GitHub repository for your project.\n2. Create a workflow file (e.g., `main.yml`) in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.\n3. Define the workflow to run on a specific event trigger (e.g., push to the main branch).\n4. Use a runner to execute the workflow steps, which can include setting up a server to handle POST requests.\n5. Install necessary dependencies and configure the server to listen for POST requests.\n6. Use GitHub Actions secrets to securely store any sensitive information needed for the endpoint.\n7. Test the endpoint by sending a POST request to the server URL.\n\nHere's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow that sets up a simple server to handle POST requests:\n\n```yaml\nname: Create REST API Endpoint\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: self-hosted\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n    - name: Set up Node.js\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n      with:\n        node-version: '14'\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: npm install\n\n    - name: Start server\n      run: npm start\n```\n\nIn this example, the workflow sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and starts a server using `npm start`. You would need to have a script in your project that starts a server listening for POST requests.\n\nRemember to adjust the workflow and server setup according to your specific requirements and project structure.

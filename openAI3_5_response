Yes, it is possible to create a REST API endpoint using GitHub Actions. Here's a simple example:\n\n```yaml\nname: API Endpoint\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n        with:\n          node-version: '14'\n\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: npm install\n\n      - name: Build and start server\n        run: npm start\n```\n\nIn this example, the GitHub Actions workflow listens for pushes to the main branch, checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and then starts the server. You would need to have a Node.js server set up in your repository with a REST API endpoint defined in your code.
